# aec-backend

This is the backend to the AEC Hackathon project - [STROLL](https://github.com/Brandoncyu/aec-backend). This allows you to send emails of your spoken notes when you take your walk. You will need to run this concurrently with your frontend in order for the app to function.

To run, type the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
